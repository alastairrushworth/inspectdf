\title{Summary and comparison of the rate of missingness across dataframe columns}
\usage{
inspect_na(df1, df2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{A data frame}

\item{df2}{An optional second data frame for making columnwise comparison of missingness.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarising the count and percentage of columnwise missingness 
for one or a pair of data frames.
}
\description{
For a single dataframe, summarise the rate of missingness in each 
column.  If two dataframes are supplied, compare missingness for columns appearing 
in both dataframes.  For grouped dataframes, summarise the rate of missingness
separately for each group.
}
\details{
For a \strong{single dataframe}, the tibble returned contains the columns: \cr
\itemize{
  \item \code{col_name}, a character vector containing column names of \code{df1}.
  \item \code{cnt}, an integer vector containing the number of missing values by 
  column.
  \item \code{pcnt}, the percentage of records in each columns that is missing.
}
For a \strong{pair of dataframes}, the tibble returned contains the columns: \cr
\itemize{
  \item \code{col_name}, the name of the columns occurring in either \code{df1} or \code{df2}.
  \item \code{cnt_1}, \code{cnt_2}, a pair of integer vectors containing counts of missing entries
  for each column in \code{df1} and \code{df2}.
  \item \code{pcnt_1}, \code{pcnt_2}, a pair of columns containing percentage of missing entries
  for each column in \code{df1} and \code{df2}.
  \item \code{p_value}, the p-value associated with test of equivalence of rates of missingness.  Small 
  values indicate evidence that the rate of missingness differs for a column occurring 
  in both \code{df1} and \code{df2}.
}
For a \strong{grouped dataframe}, the tibble returned is as for a single dataframe, but where 
the first \code{k} columns are the grouping columns.  There will be as many rows in the result 
as there are unique combinations of the grouping variables.

# Load dplyr for tdf data & pipe
library(dplyr)

# Single dataframe summary
inspect_na(tdf)

# Paired dataframe comparison
inspect_na(tdf, tdf[1:20, ])

# Grouped dataframe summary
